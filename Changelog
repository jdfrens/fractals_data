# Changelog

* The "old repo" is https://github.com/jdfrens/mandelbrot which has a lot of history in its commits.
* This repo was created from the old repo with everything but the data files deleted.
* The "Elixir version" or "Elixir code" or "Elixir whatever" is https://github.com/jdfrens/fractals_elixir which is a
clone of the old repo with everything but the Elixir solution removed.

## v0.2.0 2018-11-26

* New format with nested configuration.

## v0.1.0 2018-11-16

* First version with a long history from the old repo.
* Format is very flat.
* Kept up-to-date with Elixir solution; probably not good for the Haskell solution back in the old repo.
