# Functional, Concurrent, Parallel Computation of Fractals

This is an old, abadoned repo.  All of the interesting code has been moved to other repos.  I leave this one here for historical reasons.

## Haskell code

This is probably terribly out of date and not a good example of Haskell (if it ever was).  I leave it here for reference.  If I return to it, I will probably create a new repository for it.

## Erlang code

This was never good code, and I abandoned it long ago.  I'm writing a fractal generator in Elixir instead.

## Elixir code

Check out the separate (forked) repository for my Elixir solution: https://github.com/jdfrens/fractals_elixir

## Rust code

I'm going to write a solution in Rust.  No really.  I'm writing this section in this README so that I _have_ to do it!
