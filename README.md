# Functional, Concurrent, Parallel Computation of Fractals

I'm a computer hacker.  I love fractals.  I love computing fractals.

I'm a functional programmer.  I love concurrency.  I love parallelism (and wrote a dissertation on it).

I'm a polyglot.  I love Haskell.  I love Scheme.  I want to love Erlang (but I have to get to know it first).

## Haskell code

The Haskell code (in the `Haskell` directory) was started in the Spring of 2008 for a programming languages course I was teaching at the time.  Check out the [github repository for that class](https://github.com/jdfrens/cs214) for the ancient history of that code.

I've worked on this code more recently to push on the parallelism so that I can compare its performance to my Erlang code.

## Erlang code

It's coming...
